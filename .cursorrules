Do not change the indentation or whitespace of the files unless explicitly asked. Maintain the existing formatting style (tabs/spaces) of the project strictly.

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:
- Do NOT add trailing whitespace at the end of any line
- Do NOT add empty lines at the end of files
- Do NOT add final newline if the file doesn't have one
- Do NOT modify lines that are not part of the actual change
- When using search_replace, include EXACT whitespace from the original file
- Preserve the exact line endings (LF, not CRLF)
- Strictly adhere to the existing file formatting
- When reading a file before editing, preserve its exact ending (with or without newline)
