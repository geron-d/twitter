CRITICAL FILE FORMATTING RULES:
- Do NOT add trailing whitespace at the end of any line
- Do NOT add empty lines at the end of files
- Do NOT add final newline if the file doesn't have one
- Do NOT modify lines that are not part of the actual change
- Preserve the exact line endings and file endings
- When reading a file, do NOT mark it as modified
- Strictly preserve the original file formatting
